# Bike Rental Patterns Analysis ðŸš²

## Research Question 
How do weather conditions and rental patterns (pickups and dropoffs) interact across different stations over the course of a year, and can we predict daily bike rental demand based on these factors?

## Project Overview
This project analyzes the relationship between weather conditions and bike rental patterns using Capital Bikes dataset. The analysis includes developing predictive models to forecast daily bike rental demand based on weather variables.
